The problem given is :
Part 1: 011000010110001101110100011001100111101100110000011011100110010101011111011101000111011100110000010111110110011000110000
Part 2:	165 162 137 145 151 147 150 164 137 163 151 170 164 63 63 
Part 3: 6e5f7468317274797477305f733178
Part 4: dHlmMHVyX25vX20wcmV9

Flag is the concatenation of the four decoded parts.


Part 1 is binary.
Part 2 is	octal
part 3 is hex
part 4 is base64

decrypting the above we get 


actf{0ne_tw0_f0ur_eight_sixteen_th1rtytw0_s1xtyf0ur_no_m0re}
