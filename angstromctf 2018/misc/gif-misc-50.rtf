the problem says that the file is a gif.
however running file command says its a png.

bin walk states that the image is actually made up of 8 smaller images in a linear fashion. concatenated to each other. thats not how you make gifs.
using any hex editor and splitting the png using the magic number , we get the flag in the 5th png
